# Java Clean Code Workshop
### Scenario : Connect 4

#### Task:
- Implement all the features of the Cucumber test - starting by creating the unit tests first and then writing only
the necessary code to make those tests pass. Repeat the red-green-refactor step until the cucumber feature passes.

- This can be completed in a group or solo.
- This will be completed using BDD and TDD disiplines and the [SOLID Object Orientated Principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
- There is no 'correct' solution the only goal is to fulfil the acceptance criteria
