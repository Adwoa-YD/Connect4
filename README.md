Java Clean Code Practice
Scenario : Connect 4

Task:
- Implement all the features of the Cucumber test - starting by creating the unit tests first and then writing only
the necessary code to make those tests pass. Repeat the red-green-refactor step until the cucumber feature passes.

- This should be completed as a group coding exercise and there is no 'correct' solution the only goal is to work 
together, fulfil the cucumber feature requirements and apply the
[SOLID Object Orientated Principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) 
to the code.
